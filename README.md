# CRM Causal Inference Challenge, 2016 July

This repository contains materials for an entry into the [causal inference
challenge](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Genetics16/competition_e.php) held
at the [Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques (CRM)
workshop](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Genetics16/index_e.php) for the short
thematic program on "Statistical Causal Inference and Applications to Genetics,"
25-29 July 2016 in Montreal, Canada.

## Directions/Roadmap

The workflow for running the preprocessing and analysis scripts for this project
is described below:

* `munge/` - contains preprocessing scripts for wrangling the data into a form
    suitable for downstream analyses.
* `src/` - contains analysis scripts for using the SuperLearner method for
    prediction and creating visualizations.
* `poster/` - contains the TeX source file (and supplementary files) for the
    poster presented in the competition.
* This project uses [R/ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html)
    for organizational purposes. See `ProjectTemplate.md` for detailed info.
