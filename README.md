## Directions/Roadmap

The workflow for running the preprocessing and analysis scripts for this project
is described below:

* `munge/` - contains preprocessing scripts for wrangling the data into a form
    suitable for downstream analyses.
* `src/` - contains analysis scripts for using the SuperLearner method for
    prediction and creating visualizations.
* `poster/` - contains the TeX source file (and supplementary files) for the
    poster presented in the competition.
* This project uses [R/ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html)
    for organizational purposes; see `ProjectTemplate.md` for instructions.
