## Directions/Roadmap

The workflow for running the preprocessing and analysis scripts for this project
is described below:

* `munge/` - contains the preprocessing scripts for putting the data set in a
    form to be used throughout the analysis.
* `src/` - contains the analysis scripts for using the SuperLearner method for
    prediction and creating supplementary visualizations.
* `poster/` - contains the TeX source files for the competition poster submitted
    to the competition; use the `Makefile` to build the PDF.
* This project uses [R/ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html),
    see `ProjectTemplate.md` for instructions for use.
